## Hi there 👋

I'm **Leticia Narumi Fujiharu** — a junior developer passionate about web technologies and continuous learning 💻

🌱 I started studying programming in **January 2024**, and I’m currently building a strong foundation in:  
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Data Structures**
- **Problem Solving**

🚀 I'm actively participating in the **Rocketseat bootcamp** and joining events like **Next Level Week (NLW)** to level up my skills and connect with the dev community.

🎯 My goal is to keep growing as a developer, applying best practices and contributing to real-world and open-source projects.
